The manual for the latest stable release of Oragono can be viewed on GitHub:
 <a href="https://github.com/oragono/oragono/blob/stable/docs/MANUAL.md">docs/MANUAL.md</a>

If you downloaded a release, a copy of the manual page for that release should be
included as `docs/MANUAL.md`.

If you are an end user of Oragono (i.e., you use Oragono to chat), you may be
interested in our user guide, also on GitHub:
 <a href="https://github.com/oragono/oragono/blob/stable/docs/USERGUIDE.md">docs/USERGUIDE.md</a>
