Ergo (formerly Oragono) is a modern IRC server written in Go. Its core design principles are:

* Being simple to set up and use
* Combining the features of an ircd, a services framework, and a bouncer (integrated account management, history storage, and bouncer functionality)
* Bleeding-edge [IRCv3](https://ircv3.net) support, suitable for use as an IRCv3 reference implementation
* Highly customizable via a rehashable (i.e., reloadable at runtime) YAML config

Other interesting features of Ergo include:

* Advanced internationalization support, including UTF-8 nicknames and channel names
* Support for running as a Tor onion service ("hidden service")
